      <p className="text-xl text-gray-800 dark:text-white pb-4 leading-relaxed">
        I'm a full-stack developer and photographer based in Taipei, Taiwan. I
        build things and tell stories. I have a Master's in Data Science from
        National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan where I graduated from
        Professor Von-Wun Soo's AI Lab.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl text-gray-800 dark:text-white pb-4 leading-relaxed">
        I'm currently working at Aillio building Roast.World. Previously, I
        worked at Belizing.com building Belizing Payments. I've worked with both
        back-end and front-end systems using languages and tools such as Ruby,
        Typescript, JavaScript, React, Ruby on Rails, and a number of others.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl text-gray-800 dark:text-white pb-4 leading-relaxed">
        In my free time, I like to roam to capture stories. I enjoy landscape
        and portrait photography. While I currently don't have any human kids, I
        do have a wonderful little Siamese cat called Lola üêà (she's back home
        in Belize) and other cats (in Taiwan) called Dian Dian and Hua Hua.
