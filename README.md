**Hi! I'm Derrick (施德睿)**

I am a full-stack software developer and photographer currently working on Roast.World and RoasTime at [Aillio](https://aillio.com/) in Taipei, Taiwan. I hold a Master's degree in Data Science from National Tsing Hua University, where I studied under AI researcher Dr. Von-Wun Soo in his [AI Lab](http://ai.cs.nthu.edu.tw/).

I have extensive experience in a variety of front-end and back-end software development frameworks and programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS, VueJS, Ruby on Rails, Ruby, and a number of others. In my free time, I enjoy capturing beautiful moments through landscape and portrait photography, and I am the proud owner of several beloved cats.

Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to gain a reputation for my creative problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and ability to adapt to new environments and become productive quickly. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer and photographer.
