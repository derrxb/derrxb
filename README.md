**Hi! I'm Derrick (施德睿)**

I'm a full-stack developer and photographer based in Taipei, Taiwan. I build things and tell stories. I have a Master's in Data Science from National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan where I graduated from Professor Von-Wun Soo's [AI Lab](http://ai.cs.nthu.edu.tw/).

I'm currently working at [Aillio](https://aillio.com/) building [Roast.World](https://roast.world/). Previously, I worked at [Belizing.com](https://belizing.com/) building [Belizing Payments](https://payments.belizing.com/). I've worked with both back-end and front-end systems using languages and tools such as Ruby, Typescript, JavaScript, React, Ruby on Rails, and a number of others.

In my free time, I like to roam to capture stories. I enjoy landscape and portrait photography. While I currently don't have any human kids, I do have a wonderful little Siamese cat called Lola 🐈 (she's back home in Belize) and other cats (in Taiwan) called Dian Dian and Hua Hua.

You can find me online on my handle **_@derrxb_**. But here are a few links that you might be interested in:
